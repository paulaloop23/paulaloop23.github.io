<p>The purpose of this report is to help identify possible website digital accessibility issues in order to prevent any access issues to this website via assistive technologies. The following accessibility checklist is based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/">W3C WAI Easy Checks – A First Review of Web Accessibility</a> I hope that you will find this report helpful and informative and find the recommendations to be actionable. </p>

<h2>Accessibility Checklist</h2>
<h3>Website Page Titles</h3>
<p>In the web page markup, the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> is within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag. Good page titles are particularly important for orientation, they help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser tab. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different web page is the page title.</p>

<!-- green success css class -->
<p class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Results: <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i> 10 pages on the City of Henderson website were evaluated for clear, unique HTML page titles. Each page has descriptive HTML title values. All titles also included with the descriptive value " and  Henderson, NV" to alert users using assitive techonologies that they were still within the City of Henderson site. One suggestion would be to remove the pipes between the values to have better page title per the tips from <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/#title">w3.org. </a></p>

<h3>Image Text Alternatives</h3>
<p>Image text alternatives ("alt text") (pictures, illustrations, charts, etc.) Text alternatives convey the purpose of an image, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc. The alt attribute provides an alternative text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it. The reason can be a slow connection, an error with the image file, or if the user uses a screen reader.</p>
<!-- red thumbs down css class -->
<p class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">Results: <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i> <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-down-fill"></i> There was the presense of "alt text" on most of the images but were not always as descriptive as they could be and were instead either file names or in the example of a list of icons numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4 instead of what they represent. This means that people using assistive technologies would not know what the photo or graphic is communicating. We recommend that all photos and graphics have higher quality descriptive alt text. </p>


<h3>Text:</h3>
 <p>Headings, Contrast Ratio ("color contrast") and Resizing Text should not only support visual aesthetics but also support the navigation and visibility of text content. </p>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">Results - Headings<i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i> 
We tested the Boards & Commissions, Police Department and the Municipal Court pages and headings tags are nested correctly. However, on those pages there were two H1 tags, there should only be one H1 per page because screen readers expect only one H1 tag. </div>


<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
<p>Results - Contrast Ratio  <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i> We tested the Boards & Commissions, Police Department and the Municipal Court pages and there was strong color contrast because the pages are white and the heading titles are in black. The WAVE color contrast tester did flag the main navigation as a color contrast issue because of the blue background and orange text on hover or select. Using CCA Color Contrast Analyser the main navigation failed at the AAA level at the regular text size. The CCA Color Contrast Analyser also failed the grey text on the white background as an issue at the AAA level and could be an issue for low vision users. Suggestion is to make the text a little larger or bold. </p>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
<p>Results - Resizing Text  <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i>The City of Henderson website scales up text size using keyboard commands very well. Text was increased to 200% and readability remained comprehensible on a desktop. However, there were some sections on iPhone zoom that were cutoff or created a horizonal scroll</p>
</div>

 <h3>Interaction:</h3>
 <h4>Keyboard access and visual focus </h4>  
 <p>Many people cannot use a mouse and rely on a keyboard to interact with web pages. Keyboard focus should be clearly visible and should follow a logical order through the page elements. Visible keyboard focus could be a border or highlight. </p>
<!-- red success div -->
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">Results: <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i> <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-down-fill"></i> Using only keyboard keys to navigate the City of Henderson website provided mixed results. We were able to navigate through the main navigation and search with the option to "Skip to Main Content" the area between the main navigation and the section icons on the homepage did not indicate what item we were currently on meaning that the Keyboard Focus was not obvious to us when we were using our tab and arrow keys. We recommend that the web team explore to make the City of Henderson website more keyboard-only friendly. One issue we found was on the <a href="https://www.cityofhenderson.com/our-city/initiatives/education"> Education page </a> where the "Skip to Content" went directly to the form at the bottom instead of the main content at the top of the page. 
</div>


<h4>Forms, labels, and errors (including Search fields): </h4>
Users are able to keyboard navigate to the different forms fields. 
Each form control has a label element with a for attribute that matches the value of the id attribute in the related control. For example:
<ul>
    <li>Each form control has a <code>label</code> element with a <code>for</code> attribute that  matches the value of the <code>id</code> attribute in the related control. For example:<br>
        <code>&lt;label for="firstname"&gt;First name: &lt;/label&gt;<br>
        &lt;input type="text" name="firstname" id="firstname" /&gt;<br>
        </code> </li>
        <li>Each <code>id</code> is unique within the web page.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<p>Results <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i> <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-down-fill"></i>
    We tested the Submit Request form that was found when selecting the "ADA/508 friendly site" link from the Contact Us section because it has a form. 
    Using only the keyboard, we were able to go to each form field and press submit. 
    However, using the Wave tool, the <a href="https://clients.comcate.com/ada_home.php">Submit Request Form</a> page has a 2 inputs on the web form that do not have labels with a related unique ID. The form itself was also flagged using Wave for having very small text.</p>
</div>


 <h3>General:</h3>
 <p>Moving, Flashing, or Blinking Content: Moving, flashing, or blinking content includes carousels (example carousel), ads, videos, auto-updating stock tickers, scrolling news feeds, and more. 
    Users need to be able to control moving content, especially some people with attention deficit disorder or visual processing disorders.</p>
 
 <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
 <p>Results: <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-down-fill"></i><i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i> The City of Henderson has an image carousel on the homepage that auto advances very quickly and does not allow the user to take their time to read the accomanying text. There are controls to advance and reverse the carousel but not to pause. The alt text on the images are also not very descriptive and repeat the heading. We recommend that the current image carousel is replaced with an <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/carousels/">accessible image carousel</a>. No blinking or flashing content was located on the CCC website.</p>
</div>


 <p>Basic Structure Check: It helps you understand how some people "see" the web page differently. For this basic structure check, you look at the web page without images, styles, and layout.
Web pages are often designed with multiple columns, sections, colors, and other visual aspects that help organize information for people who see the page in its default display. 
However, some people do not see the page this way.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
    <p>Results: <i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-down-fill"></i><i class="bi bi-hand-thumbs-up-fill"></i> For this test, we used WAVE to remove all CSS styles in order to see the City of Henderson website without any visual styling. We tested the homepage and noticed that this page has a logical flow of information even without styling. Although when scrolling through the carousel area, the page kept jumping back to that section. Not sure why this is happening but this could be a problem for people navigating to items further down. </p>
</div>
